# Time Series Explained

## Description
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook detailing the fundamental concepts of time series, with in-depth explanations and practical examples. It covers time series data analysis techniques, predictive models, and evaluation methods, using popular libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Statsmodels. This project is designed for those who want to understand and master time series, whether for data modeling or applications in machine learning and artificial intelligence.
